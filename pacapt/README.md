DESCRIPTION
===========

Installs `pacapt`, a wrapper for system package manager.

The main script of `pacapt` is `pacman` which is put in the directory
`files`. You may need to execute `make update` to update that file (the
script will be downloaded from master branch of the repository `pacapt`
from `github`.)

The cookbook will install the script `pacman` to `/usr/local/bin/`.
